  Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing
  styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes
  to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
  A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient". 
</p>
<p>
  Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead
  designer of the original Defense of the Ancients mod,
  was hired by Valve to create a modernized remake in 
  the Source game engine. It was officially released
  for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal
  computers via the digital distribution platform Steam
  in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began two years prior. As the game is fully free-to-play with no heroes needing to be bought or unlocked, revenue is made from microtransactions, specifically loot boxes, battle passes, and a monthly-based subscription system called Dota Plus, which all offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods, such as cosmetic hero armor and weapon replacements, in return. The game has also been updated with various other features since release, such as support for virtual reality (VR) and a full transition to the Source 2 engine in 2015.


</p>
<p>Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, Dota 2 was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with multiple gaming publications later considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Since its release, it has been one of the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise for it being produced, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes
  , maps, and hero
  cosmetics,
  which are
  uploaded to
  the Steam Workshop and curated by Valve. A digital collectible card game by Valve based on Dota 2, titled Artifact, will be released in November 2018.</p>
