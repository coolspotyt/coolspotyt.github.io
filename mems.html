                        An Internet meme, commonly known as just meme[2][3][4][5] (/miːm/ MEEM),
                        is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of media that spreads, 
                        often as mimicry or for humorous purposes, from person to person via the
                        Internet.[6] An Internet meme usually takes the form of an image (traditionally an image macro[7]),
                        GIF or video. It may be just a word or phrase, sometimes including an intentional
                        misspelling. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via social
                        networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various existing
                        Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites, or by Usenet boards and other
                        such early-Internet communications facilities. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet because the instant communication facilitates word-of-mouth transmission. Some examples include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called "planking") and uploading a short video of people dancing to the Harlem Shake.

                    <p>The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish
                        Gene as an attempt to explain the way cultural information spreads;[8]
                        Internet memes are a subset of this general meme concept specific to the
                        culture and environment of the Internet. The concept of the Internet meme
                        was first proposed by Mike Godwin in the June 1993 issue of Wired. In 2013,
                        Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished from biological genes and his own pre-Internet concept of a meme, which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection.[9] Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a "hijacking of the original idea", the very idea of a meme having mutated and evolved in this new direction.[10] Further, Internet memes carry an additional property that ordinary memes do not—Internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable.[1
                    </p>
                    <p>An Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, parody, or by incorporating news accounts about itself. Internet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days. Internet memes usually are formed from some social interaction, pop culture reference, or situations people often find themselves in. Their rapid growth and impact has caught the attention of both researchers and industry.[14] Academically, researchers model how they evolve and predict which memes will survive and spread throughout the Web. Commercially, they are used in viral marketing where they are an inexpensive form of mass advertising.

                            One empirical approach studied meme characteristics and behavior independently from the networks in which they propagated, and reached a set of conclusions concerning successful meme propagation.[11] For example, the study asserted that Internet memes not only compete for viewer attention generally resulting in a shorter life, but also, through user creativity, memes can collaborate with each other and achieve greater survival.[11] Also, paradoxically, an individual meme that experiences a popularity peak significantly higher than its average popularity is not generally expected to survive unless it is unique, whereas a meme with no such popularity peak keeps being used together with other memes and thus has greater survivability.[11]
                            
                            Multiple opposing studies on media psychology and communication have aimed to characterise and analyse the concept and representations in order to make it accessible for the academic research.[15][16] Thus, Internet memes can be regarded as a unit of information which replicates via internet. This unit can replicate or mutate. This mutation instead of being generational[8] follows more a viral pattern,[17] giving the Internet memes generally a short life. Other theoretical problems with the Internet memes are their behaviour, their type of change, and their teleology.[15]
                            
                            Writing for The Washington Post in 2013, Dominic Basulto asserted that with the growth of the Internet and the practices of the marketing and advertising industries, memes have come to transmit fewer snippets of human culture that could survive for centuries as originally envisioned by Dawkins, and instead transmit banality at the expense of big ideas.</p>
